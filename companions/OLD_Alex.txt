These advising tools are intended to help frame your reflections throughout your time at Stanford, guide your strategic thinking if you face challenges or difficulty, facilitate your academic planning and intellectual development, and support you as you consider post-undergraduate education. They may be used cooperatively during an advising conversation or you may use them on your own, to help you prepare for a conversation with your Academic Advisor.

Stanford offers a wealth of opportunities to grow and challenge yourself, both in and outside the classroom. The office of Academic Advising is dedicated to introducing you to the full richness of undergraduate study at Stanford, and to supporting you in your academic and intellectual pursuits.

Your relationship with your Advisor(s) is an ongoing conversation and partnership that is ideally characterized by mutual respect, engagement, and responsiveness. You can get the most out of advising if you:

Bring your questions, ideas, and reflections about what is working for you (and what isn’t) to your meetings, understanding that participation is a critical part of the advising conversation.
Be open and honest about your background, specific academic or other goals you may have, as well as special needs or circumstances that may affect your experience.
Be respectful of their time (and know that they will be respectful of yours). Keep your appointments, or notify your advisor in a timely fashion if you need to cancel or reschedule for any reason.
Try to remain open to possibilities they suggest, but understand that you are the author of your own education.
Reflection Throughout Your Time at Stanford
These resources provide structure for you to pause and reflect on your Stanford experience. Talking through these prompts with your Academic Advisor—or working through them prior to an advising conversation—may help you contextualize your experiences, make plans, and set goals for yourself. It can also help you appreciate how far you have already come, and to take inventory of all you’re learning along the way.


Facing Challenges or Difficulty
Throughout your time at Stanford, you will challenge yourself academically, intellectually, or personally. As you do so, working with your Academic Advisor to develop strategies for facing difficulty, even disappointment, can help you navigate this natural part of the learning process. These resources may help frame those conversations and reflect on how you might use the insight and guidance provided.


Academic Planning and Intellectual Development
Intellectual development and identity may be forged in the making (and revision) of your academic plans. These tools are designed to help you connect seemingly disparate experiences, relationships, plans, and decisions with your education as a whole. Your Academic Advisor can help you by asking questions about what motivates you, what concerns you, what inspires you, and what thriving at Stanford means for you.

Post-undergraduate Considerations
Becoming a lifelong learner can mean many different things, including formal study that continues beyond your time at Stanford. Stanford has a team of Academic Advisors who specialize in pre-professional advising and who have expertise in the process of preparing and applying for medical school, law school, business school, or graduate school. These resources are provided to help you prepare for advising conversations about post-undergraduate study.

The First Few Quarters: 0 – 45 Units (or so)
The first three quarters of your undergraduate journey at Stanford will comprise, on average 12-15
units a quarter. Typically, by the end of Frosh Year you will have taken or completed between 36-45
units. This may be more units depending on whether you have AP/IB units or transferred some units
to Stanford. You should spend time exploring Cardinal Compass, which is an amazing collection of
important and useful information created by your Academic Advisors as you are planning your first
quarter, your first year, and beyond.
Your first year should be a year of academic and intellectual exploration. While you may think that
you know what you will study, it is important to remember that Stanford has a very diverse offering
of fields of study, and that exploring new topics is a very valuable part of your academic journey.
There are several ways that you can explore new courses and areas of study:
• Frosh-Friendly Courses
• One-Unit Wonders and Terrific Twos
• Introductory Seminars (Introsems)

During your first year, it is especially important to have continuing conversations with your
Academic Advisor. You will have conversations about your academic plans and considerations, but
you can and should also come to your Academic Advisor to discuss:
• Adjusting to college life
o Time and effort involved in a change of environment can take its toll; it may “feel” like
you’re taking an extra course on adjusting to college. Be aware of this phenomenon.

• Building and improving academic skills
o The change in study skills or learning style from high school to college is significant;
some modifications are subtle while others are coarse. Talk to your advisors about it.

• Learning of resources on campus and how to get support
o A wealth of resources are available and can present solutions to challenges you’ll face.
• Managing time between courses, extracurriculars, wellness
o In his book Making the Most of College, Harvard educator and author Richard J. Light
identifies time management as one of the single most important factors that leads to
student satisfaction in many areas of their college experience.
• Learning more about how to reach out and connect with faculty
o For more about how to connect, refer to the Syllabus Insert “Engaging with Faculty”.

How to Declare: Majors, Minors and Notations
Main content start
The process of declaring a major varies by department. For many majors, you will be asked to fill out a Program Sheet that charts the courses you will take to complete the major. You then have that program sheet approved by your faculty Major Advisor in a meeting, and then finalize your declaration in Axess.

You can find general advice about declaring here in the Advising Student Handbook. Some departments have alternative—or additional—requirements for declaration; for example, they may have you write a reflective essay, or meet with a peer advisor. Select a tile below to see the specific declaration process for that major, and be aware: selecting a major in Axess is often the smallest and least important step in this process! 

Stanford has a vibrant and engaged first-gen and/or low-income (FLI) community. We are committed to supporting all our students on their academic journey. And while college can sometimes be a tough experience, your Academic Advisors are here to help you along your way.

First and foremost, welcome! We know it wasn’t easy to get here, and the fact that you made it is a testament to your talent and hard work. At the same time, we know that Stanford can be a challenging environment for everyone.

Your Academic Advisors have seen a lot of students pass through this campus over the years. And we’ve learned that what makes for a successful Stanford student isn’t necessarily your intelligence or abilities. Getting into Stanford already demonstrates that you have talent and smarts. The most successful students learn when and how to ask for help when they need it, and aren’t afraid to make use of all the resources available to them.

That’s it. That’s the secret to Stanford success. Have the courage to ask for help, and take advantage of your resources. Here's where you can find out more about:  

Advising Resources
Every Stanford student is assigned an Academic Advisor at the start of the new school year. We know Stanford is a confusing place, and we're here to help! We can offer advice on academic issues like choosing courses, picking a major, fulfilling your requirements, and applying for research grants. But it's also fine just to come chat with us about how you're doing and how college is going for you.
You can sign up for a meeting with your Academic Advisor through an easy online system. It just takes a few clicks, and you don't have to ask for permission first! Many times you can sign up for a meeting with us on the same day, or on the next day. Most of us also have drop-in hours at certain days, times, and locations where you can just swing by without an appointment.
Your Academic Advisor can help with general questions about preparing for medical school or law school. Once you become more certain of your plans and want to discuss the choice of program and the application process in greater detail, you can also schedule a meeting with one of our terrific pre-professional advisors!
From Autumn to Spring, we have rotating Academic Advisors offering drop-in hours at the FLI Office.  During drop-in hours, feel free to stop by with any and all academic-related questions, no appointment necessary!  The FLI Office will send out details to students on their mailing list for drop-in hours days and times once they are set each quarter.
During FLI Office Drop-in Hours, we also have advisors from Stanford's Career Education Center and from the Haas Center for Public Service available in case you want to talk to someone about internships, resumes and cover letters, or career development; or about getting involved with public service.
